# Template for CodeRefinery workshop webpage

This repository is a template to set up webpages for CodeRefinery workshops.

To use it, follow these instructions:
- Click the green "Use this template" button.
- Select owner of the new repository and repository name. The name should be 
  "year-month-date-city", e.g. "2019-10-16-stockholm".
- Click "Create repository from template"
- You will now be redirected to the new repository.

Information in the new repository now needs to be updated. Only the 
`index.md` file needs to be updated, which can be done either 
by cloning the new repository, editing it locally and pushing 
the changes, or by editing it directly in the browser by selecting `index.md`
and clicking the pen symbol (Edit this file) on the right.
Instructions for updating the required fields can be found in `index.md`.
