## Certificates and credits

It is possible to obtain a certificate from the course with a little extra
work.  The certificate is equivalent to 1 ECTS and your study supervisor will
be able to register it as a credit in your university study credit system.
**Please make sure that your supervisor/study program accepts it**.

Learners with a valid Aalto student number will automatically get the credit
registered in Aalto systems.  Please note that this does not apply to
participants affiliated with TU Delft who have own criteria for workshop
certificates and credits.

To obtain a certificate, we expect you to follow the 6 days of the course and
provide us with the following three documents via email:

1. The output of `git log --all` from the repositories that you have used
   during the course as a text file. Evaluation criteria: we expect to see the
   results from most of the git commands that are run in the first 3 days of
   the workshop.
2. Written answers to the following four questions submitted as a document (pdf
   or word or txt). Evaluation criteria: we expect critical answers related to
   the content of first 3 days wit h both pros and cons (when relevant):
    - When should you work with branches?
    - What is the difference between a `git clone` and a `git fork`?
    - What is the difference between a fork and a branch?
    - What advantages and disadvantages to code review can you imagine/list?
3. A personal reflection for each of the 6 days written as a document (pdf or
   word or txt, one paragraph per day). To get started, you can try answering
   the questions: "Why is this important? How can it improve my research work?"
   However any other personal reflection is welcome. Evaluation criteria: we
   expect reflections that are related to the content of each of the six days.

During the workshop we will provide with contact addresses where you should
send these documents to.
