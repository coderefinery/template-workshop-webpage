**There is no deadline** and you are welcome to register and join even after
the event started. **You can attend just those days or sessions you want** but
please register anyway.

**Should all in a team sign up? Or only one person?** We recommend that all
register so that they get all necessary information.

**If you want to join as organization** to provide local helpers or in-person
sessions, please do! This usually takes the form of a "watching party" with
coordinated breaks for exercises.

**Some organizations offer their own registration form**. In this case please
register with them and then you do not have to register here centrally as well.
We will then make sure that everybody gets all necessary information.
