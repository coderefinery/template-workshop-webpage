we use](requirements/#privacy-and-tools-online-services).

**If you want to join as organization** to provide local helpers or in-person
sessions, please do!  This usually takes the form of a "watching party" with
coordinated breaks for exercises.  You can manage that on your own but all
participants should still register with us individually so that they get all
necessary practical information and support.
