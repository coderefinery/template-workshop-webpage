**There is no deadline** and you are welcome to register and join even after
the event started.

**You can attend just those days you want** but please register anyway!  
Skip the lessons you already know or don't fit you schedule.
For the days you cannot attend but would like to learn check the lesson material (links in the schedule below).

**Before signing up** please also read [this privacy note about tools/services
we use](requirements/#privacy-and-tools-online-services).

**If you want to join as organization** to provide local helpers or in-person
sessions, please do!  This usually takes the form of a "watching party" with
coordinated breaks for exercises.  You can manage that on your own but all
participants should still register with us individually so that they get all
necessary practical information and support.

**Should all in a team sign up? Or only one person?** We recommend that all
register so that they get all necessary information. Team leads for local
exercise groups can select "I am attending a local exercise room" and "I might
be interested in being a team leader".
