## Audience

Are you doing any of these things below:
- You write scripts to process data.
- You change scripts written by your colleagues.
- You write code that is used in research by you or others.

... and if you have these kinds of problems:
- You wish you could re-run your own code after a few months.
- You wish you could reproduce your own results better.
- You wish you could automate your work better.
- You, or your group, can't share or reuse code.
- You overall want to become more efficient at your work, by using the
  best possible tools.

... then this course is for you. This is not designed for
"professional code developers" or computer scientists, or to make you
one.

You can register with your friends/group as a **team** and you'll work
together in breakout rooms, and you'll be able to work together after
the course as well.


## What we will not teach

This is not a course about a specific programming language or
the Linux/Unix terminal shell. We assume that you are familiar with the programming
language that you use in your work and research. Most of the course
applies to any programming language, though our default language for
examples is Python (but we do have examples in other languages, too).


## Be an exercise leader

Do you know some of the topics, but want to review them, why not
attend as an exercise leader?  You don't need to be an expert: if you
have been through CodeRefinery once or have some familiarity with the
topics, and you are confident to call an expert helper when needed, then you
have all it takes to lead a team to success.  [Read more
