## Who the course is for

Are you doing any of these things below:
- You write scripts to process data.
- You change scripts written by your colleagues.
- You write code that is used in research by you or others.

If yes, then this course is for you. This is not designed for
"professional code developers" or computer scientists.


## What we will not teach

This is not a course about a specific programming language or
the Linux/Unix terminal shell. We assume that you are familiar with the programming
language that you use in your work and research. We try to keep the course as
language-independent as possible, however we will show some basic code examples in
Python.
