This course is not designed for "professional software engineers" or to make
you one.

You can register with your friends/group as a **team** and you'll work together
in exercise rooms, and you'll be able to work together after the course as
well.


## What we will not teach

This is not a course about a specific programming language or the Linux/Unix
terminal shell. We assume that you are somehow familiar with the programming
language that you use in your work and research. Most of the course applies to
any programming language.


## Be an exercise leader

Do you know some of the topics, but want to review them, why not
attend as an exercise leader?  You don't need to be an expert: if you
have been through CodeRefinery once or have some familiarity with the
topics, and you are confident to call an expert helper when needed, then you
have all it takes to lead a team to success.  [Read more
