## Course goals

In this course, you will become familiar with tools and best practices for
scientific software development. This course will not teach a programming
language, but we teach the tools you need to do programming well and avoid
common inefficiency traps. The tools we teach are practically a requirement for
any scientist who needs to write code. The main focus is on using
Git for efficiently writing and maintaining research software.


## Audience

Do you identify with any of these below, then this course is for you:

<div class="uk-card uk-card-primary uk-card-hover uk-card-body uk-light uk-column-1-2@s uk-column-1-3@m">

- You write scripts to process data.
- You change scripts written by your colleagues.
- You write code that is used in research by you or others.
- You wish you could re-run your own code after a few months.
- You wish you could reproduce your own results better.
- You wish you could automate your work better.
- You, or your group, can't share or reuse code.
- You overall want to become more efficient at your work, by using the
  best possible tools.

This course is not designed for "professional software engineers" or to make
you one. You can register with your friends/group as a **team** and you'll
work together in exercise rooms, and you'll be able to work together after the
course as well.


## What we will not teach

This is not a course about a specific programming language or the Linux/Unix
terminal shell. We assume that you are somehow familiar with the programming
language that you use in your work and research. Most of the course applies to
any programming language.


## Format

This is an informal and interactive event with type-along lessons, live coding,
and exercises. Register with a friend!  If you feel a bit more confident in the
material, you can [register as an team leader](volunteer/).

The workshop will be held online, see options at [how to
join](join/):

- Everyone watches the main teaching via a livestream at
  <https://twitch.tv/coderefinery>. We teach on stream instead of teaching
  via Zoom to guarantee that learners cannot appear on stream or recording
  with voice or video.
- You can register to attend our Zoom exercise rooms
  ([read more](join/)).
- Some partners offer local support, such as breakout rooms, to their local
  groups.
