Dear {first_name},

We are one week away from the CodeRefinery workshop. Exciting!

Everybody, please install required software before the workshop (we made it a lot easier this time):
- https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/
- We offer two install help sessions (today and in two days; Tue and Thu): (URL shared with registrants)
- Schedule in your time zone: https://coderefinery.github.io/2024-03-12-workshop/#schedule

If you are a team leader or organize a local classroom, please come to one of our on-boarding sessions:

- Zoom link for on-boarding sessions: (URL shared with registrants)


**For all workshop participants**, here are all relevant resources that you need to connect:

You can follow the workshop lectures via Twitch in a web browser, no account needed:

Please use this collaborative document to ask questions during the workshop:

Schedule and lecture material:
- https://coderefinery.github.io/2024-03-12-workshop/#schedule
- Each day we will take a break for lunch, which we have done our best to schedule at a time that will work for most locations as we are across multiple time zones.
- We are still working on updating the Git lessons. This time we plan to work more in the browser and editor and less in the terminal.


If you have any questions, please write to support@coderefinery.org or reply to me.


Best regards,

Radovan and the CodeRefinery team
