## Communication with participants

Here we collect email texts which we have sent to participants.  They are
hopefully useful for late registrations or future workshops.

For those who draft the emails: you can diff the Markdown files to see variations.

<div class="uk-alert-danger" uk-alert>
  <a class="uk-alert-close" uk-close></a>
  <p>
    If you registered late and cannot find the video or Q&A document links, can
    you please contact us (bottom of page)?
