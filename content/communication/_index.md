## Communication with participants

Here we collect email texts which we have sent to participants.  They are
hopefully useful for late registrations or future workshops.

<div class="uk-alert-danger" uk-alert>
  <a class="uk-alert-close" uk-close></a>
  <p>
    If you registered late and cannot find the link to the Q&A document,
    please contact us. See the bottom of this page for contact details.
