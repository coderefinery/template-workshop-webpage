Dear {first_name},

Thank you for joining the workshop last week, and for all the wonderful questions we got from you!
For those who join us now for the second week only, welcome!
- All questions and answers are archived: https://coderefinery.github.io/2024-03-12-workshop/questions/
- Video recordings are published: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eUUd40HkYI&list=PLpLblYHCzJADIsbUhXSrC0qW5wDsH-F9U

We hope you got some good practice and understanding on how to collaborate using Git/GitHub and our trial of collaborating with you from the stream worked out for you! If you have suggestions on how to improve our lessons, please open issues or send pull requests:
- https://github.com/coderefinery/git-intro
- https://github.com/coderefinery/git-collaborative


This week will be a little more diverse!

We will take a peek into six topics that are all related to FAIR research software development:

Tuesday will start with an overview of how all CodeRefinery lessons fit together under the umbrella of reproducible research and what steps you can take now already to make your research more reproducible. In the afternoon we will look into licenses, how they work and why you might want to care even when "only writing a small script for myself".

Wednesday morning we look at different ways of how to document research code. From small projects with good README files to external documentation on Read the Docs. In the afternoon we will show some tips and tricks around Jupyter notebooks and how they can be used also outside of courses.

Thursday we step a little deeper into software development practices by giving you an introduction into automated testing and how this could benefit you and your collaborators. The workshop ends with some live coding to showcase how to make code more reusable by caring about modularity.

In contrast to week 1, there will not be any dedicated exercise times in week 2. Instead, instructors will demo things and discuss with you using the collaborative document. If you want, you can of course try to follow the demos or try to do them on your own time after the workshop. For this, you will need to install some tools which you can find at: https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/.

We hope to see you again this week with the first session starting Tuesday at 9:00 CET (10 EET). We will start the stream 10 minutes earlier: https://coderefinery.github.io/2024-03-12-workshop/#schedule


Best regards,

CodeRefinery team
