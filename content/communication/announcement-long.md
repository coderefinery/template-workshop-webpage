Are you writing code and managing data for your research? Do you feel like
wasting too much time on manual work? Do you struggle to understand and reuse older code?

Join
the CodeRefinery workshop,
**ADAPT DATES**,
for free and online.

The workshop covers good coding practices, reproducible research principles,
and using Git for collaboration. It offers breakout room exercises with team
leaders, and you can register as a team or volunteer as a team leader.
But you can also follow on your own if you prefer.
In-person exercise sessions are available in some locations.
