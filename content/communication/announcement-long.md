Are you writing code and managing data for your research? Do you feel like
wasting too much time on manual work? Do you struggle to understand old code?

Join the CodeRefinery workshop on **ADAPT DATES**, for free and
online.

The workshop covers good coding practices, reproducible research principles,
and using Git for collaboration. It offers breakout room exercises with team
leaders, and you can register as a team or volunteer as a leader.  In-person
exercise sessions are available in some locations.  But you can also follow on
your own if you prefer.
