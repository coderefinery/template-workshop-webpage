CodeRefinery workshop on tools and techniques for reproducible research

Are you writing code for your research?
Do you struggle to reproduce results of your own or others computations?

Join the online CodeRefinery workshop on six half days, **ADAPT DATES**.

The CodeRefinery workshop aims to support researchers of all domains,
levels and preferred programming languages to write more reproducible research code.

The workshop is held online (streamed on Twitch) with interactive hands-on sessions during the first week.
Some locations may offer in-person events, and you may also join with your own classroom
(please contact us if this option sparks your interest).

The event is free of charge.
