Do you write code for your research? Do you manage data? Most importantly, are
you doing it properly? Has it ever happened to you to have to rewrite or simply
copy-paste codes from one folder to another, possibly losing things during the
process? Have you ever opened an old code you wrote and had no clue what it
does? Maybe you feel you waste a lot of time doing a lot of manual work to
process your data and would like to automate it? Or maybe you also are not
doing any of this yet, but would like to avoid these issues from happening in
the future and do things properly from the beginning?

If you answered yes to any of the previous questions, then you are strongly
encouraged to participate to the CodeRefinery workshop on **ADAPT DATES**.
It will be fully online and free.

Topics covered in the workshop include:
- Using Git to maintain your codes and collaborate with others
- Principles of reproducible research and FAIR
- Good coding practices in general (writing documentation, testing, how to
  choose an appropriate license)

The Workshop will not teach you to code, but all the "good practice skills"
that are needed to write good maintainable software and achieve reproducible
research.

The workshop will alternate type along tutorials given by instructors to
break-out room exercises where you will get to practice. Each breakout room
will have an team leader to help you. You can also register as a team, in
which case the team will be in the same break out room (you can also exercise
together in-person if you prefer), each team can propose their own exercise
leader otherwise they will be assigned one. If you already have some experience
and would like to strengthen your skills and help others, you can also
volunteer as an team leader. Some places also offer in-person exercise
sessions, check if there is a session offered near you from the workshop page
below.
