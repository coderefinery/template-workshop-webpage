Dear {first_name},

This email is only relevant if you plan to participate in the CodeRefinery workshop this Thursday as individual learner and are not part of a team or a local exercise group.

On Thursday we will all practice how to collaborate using Git/GitHub and one ambitious thing we will try is to collaborate with participants following via stream.

If you would like to participate as individual learner in the collaborative exercises, please request access by opening an issue at https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/access-requests/issues/new/choose (There click "Get started" -> "Submit new issue")

This way we will know your GitHub username and give you write access to exercise repositories.

After we add you as collaborator, you will get an email from GitHub.
- Please accept the invitation
- Don't forget to "unwatch" both https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/centralized-workflow-exercise and https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/centralized-workflow-exercise-recorded to make sure you don't get too many emails during the exercise.
- To "unwatch", go to the repository and click the "Unwatch" button (top middle of the screen) and then select "Participating and @mentions".

Best regards,

Radovan and the CodeRefinery team
