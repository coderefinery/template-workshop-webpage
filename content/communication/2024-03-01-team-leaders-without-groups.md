Dear all,

You have indicated that you might want to help out as team leader but don't have a team yet.
Thank you for your interest in helping the CodeRefinery to become an educational experience for everyone!

This time, we do not provide a central exercise Zoom for learners and team leaders without own groups.
However, you can still support the workshop and here are few options:

- Be available for questions. During the workshop we will use a collaborative document for asynchronous Q&A, you can help by answering questions there and keeping things organized.
- Gather colleagues and organize a (virtual) room to watch the workshop stream together and discuss the exercises of week 1. You can also organize additional exercise or help sessions around the workshop.
- Advertise the workshop in your networks. Let us know if we can help by providing texts or so.

In any case you are welcome to attend our team leader onboarding session, to get to know about the different options:
- Zoom link: (URL)
- Schedule: https://coderefinery.github.io/2024-03-12-workshop/#schedule

If you have any questions, please write to me or support@coderefinery.org.

Thank you,

Radovan and the CodeRefinery team
