## Volunteer at CodeRefinery

CodeRefinery's mission is to enable everyone to use the computational
tools they need for their work.  We do this by teaching the most important
software development tools, which are often missed in other coursework.
This is a big task, but together with our volunteer exercise leaders,
we can do it.

Volunteer to be an **exercise leader** at CodeRefinery, and you will:
- Mentor and provide positive encouragement for your team; guide them
  through the workshop.
- Attend our quick exercise leader training (one hour, see schedule).
- Have your own team (breakout room of ~5) during the course.
- Help keep the team on track.  You are the first line, but you don't
  need to know everything.
- Call for other help when needed.  We are constantly moving around
  exercise rooms anyway.

**Am I good enough to be a exercise leader?**  If you are asking this
question, probably you are.  You should have some familiarity with
Git, provide some initial advice on obvious error messages, and
be able to call us for advanced help when it's needed.

**You don't have to be located in the Nordics**. We welcome volunteers from
institutions also outside the Nordics because volunteer exercise leaders help
us to reach more people.

**How do I register as an exercise leader?** Our registration
form has an option to indicate your interest to participate as exercise leader.

**Teams?**  If you have friends or colleagues you would like to
mentor, register as a team.  First off, if a team has an
exercise leader, it will almost certainly be accepted.  Second, working
together makes it much more likely to have a lasting effect in your group.
