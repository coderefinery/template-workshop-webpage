## Volunteer at CodeRefinery

CodeRefinery's mission is to enable everyone to be the best
computational scientist they can be by teaching the most important
software development skills which usually aren't taught otherwise.
This is a big task, but together with our volunteer exercise leaders,
we can do it.

Volunteer to be an **exercise leader** at CodeRefienry, and you will:
- Get our quick exercise leader training (one hour, see schedule)
- Have your own team (breakout room) during the course
- Help keep the team on track.  You are the first line of mentoring
  and debugging, but you don't need to know everything.
- Call for others when needed.  We are constantly rotating around
  breakout rooms anyway.

Don't be intimated.  The amount of initial knowledge you need isn't
that much: if you have been to a CodeRefinery before, or have some
basic familiarity with the command line, the some of tools we
teach, and aren't too afraid of reading error messages, you will do
fine.  Your job is more to guide people than solve every problem.

**Am I good enough to be a exercise leader?**  If you are asking this
question, probably you are.  You should have some familiarity with
git, provide some initial advice on obvious error messages, and
be able to call us for advanced help when it's needed.

**How do I register as an exercise leader?** Our normal registration
form has an option for this registration option.

**Teams?**  If you have friends or colleagues you would like to
mentor, register as part of a team.  First off, if a team has an
exercise leader, it will almost certainly be accepted.  Second, working
together makes it much more likely to have a lasting effect.
