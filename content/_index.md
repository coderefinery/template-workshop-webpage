## Registration

Why is there not just one registration page? Because we allow teams and organizations
to self-organize their registration process and some organizations prefer that.

<div class="alert alert-info">

[General registration](https://indico.neic.no/event/LINK/) (Anyone worldwide may
register here for basic online attendance with no obligation.  You may
be interested in one of the following special attendee groups, in
which case you don't need to register here, but still can):
- Finland: anyone in Finland can attend the course together with other people in Otaniemi room.  People registering with country=Finland will receive informaiton about this possibility.

</div>

**If you want to join as organization** to provide local helpers or
in-person sessions, please do!  This usually takes the form of a
"watching party" with coordinated breaks for exercises.  You can
manage that on your own and all
we will ask you is to let us know so that we can report the impact. Later
(during or after the workshop) we will ask you to give us actual participation
numbers and also provide us with the affiliation contry/countries of the
participants and their career stage/ job type.  If it is helpful for your
organization, we can also list your registration link here.


## Course goals

In this course, you will become familiar with tools and best practices
for scientific software development. This course will not teach a programming language, but we teach the tools you need
to do programming well and avoid common inefficiency traps.
The tools we teach are
practically a requirement for any scientist that has to do their own programming. The main
focus is on using Git for efficiently writing and maintaining research
software.

## Format

This is an informal and interactive event with type-along lessons,
live coding, and exercises. Learners are divided into exercise teams for
interactivity - register with a friend!  If you feel a bit more
confident in the material, you can [register as an exercise
leader](volunteer/).

The workshop will be held online, see options at [how to
join](join/):

* Everyone watches the main teaching via a livestream at
  <https://twitch.tv/coderefinery>.  If you
  register, you can get emails and link to ask questions.

* The reason why we stream the main workshop via Twitch and not via Zoom is
  that this way we can guarantee that learners cannot appear in stream or
  recording with voice or video.

* You can also register to attend our Zoom breakout rooms (limited
  places), and you will be placed into a small, interactive breakout
  room.  Please only register for Zoom if you want to actively take
  part in the exercises ([read more](join/)).

* Some partners offer in-person breakout rooms and help, see below.

**Before signing up** please also read
