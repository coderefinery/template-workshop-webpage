groups. [Become a partner](https://coderefinery.org/organization/partners/) to
support your community!

  - Local in-person exercise session and local support.
  - Possibility of credit points to those in Finland (more info later).


## Be an exercise leader

Do you know some of the topics, but want to review them, why not attend as an
[exercise leader](/join/)?  You don't need to be an expert: if you have been
through CodeRefinery once or have some familiarity with the topics, and you are
confident to call an expert helper when needed, then you have all it takes to
lead a team to success.
