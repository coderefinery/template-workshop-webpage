## Course goals

In this course, you will become familiar with tools and best practices
for scientific software development. This course will not teach a programming language, but we teach the tools you need
to do programming well and avoid common inefficiency traps.
The tools we teach are
practically a requirement for any scientist that has to do their own programming. The main
focus is on using Git for efficiently writing and maintaining research
software.

## Format

This is an informal and interactive event with type-along lessons,
live coding, and exercises. Learners are divided into exercise teams for
interactivity - register with a friend!  If you feel a bit more
confident in the material, you can [register as an exercise
leader](volunteer/).

The workshop will be held online, see options at [how to
join](join/):

* Everyone watches the main teaching via a livestream at
  <https://twitch.tv/coderefinery>.  If you
  register, you can get emails and link to ask questions.

* The reason why we stream the main workshop via Twitch and not via Zoom is
  that this way we can guarantee that learners cannot appear in stream or
  recording with voice or video.

* You can also register to attend our Zoom exercise rooms (limited
  places), and you will be placed into a small, interactive breakout
  room.  Please only register for Zoom if you want to actively take
  part in the exercises ([read more](join/)).
