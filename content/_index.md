## Partners and local exercise groups

Some partners offer local support, such as breakout rooms, to their local
teams. You can [become a partner](https://coderefinery.org/organization/partners/) to
support your community!

We collect here the exercise groups that we know:
- [**Aalto University**](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/):
  - Local in-person exercise session and local support.
  - Possibility of [credit points](@/certificates.md) to those in Finland.


## Be a team leader

Do you know some of the topics, but want to review them?
Why not [attend as a team leader](@/join.md)?
Gather some friends who want to learn the topics and follow the workshop together.
You don't need to be an expert: if you have been through CodeRefinery once or have some familiarity
with the topics, and you are confident to call an expert helper when needed,
then you have all it takes to lead a team to success.
