## Course goals

In this course, you will become familiar with tools and best practices for
scientific software development. This course will not teach a programming
language, but we teach the tools you need to do programming well and avoid
common inefficiency traps. The tools we teach are practically a requirement for
any scientist who needs to write code. The main focus is on using
Git for efficiently writing and maintaining research software.


## Format

This is an informal and interactive event with type-along lessons, live coding,
and exercises. Register with a friend!  If you feel a bit more confident in the
material, you can [register as an exercise leader](volunteer/).

The workshop will be held online, see options at [how to
join](join/):

- Everyone watches the main teaching via a livestream at
  <https://twitch.tv/coderefinery>. We teach on stream instead of teaching
  via Zoom to guarantee that learners cannot appear on stream or recording
  with voice or video.

  ([read more](join/)).

## Certificates and credits

submitting exercises.
