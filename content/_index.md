### Price

Free of charge, funded by the [Nordic e-Infrastructure
Collaboration](https://neic.no/).





### Course goals and format

In this course, you will become familiar with tools and best practices
for version control in modern research software development. The main
focus is on using Git for efficiently writing and maintaining research
software.  We don't teach programming, but we teach the tools you need
to use programming well.

This is an informal and interactive event with type-along type
of presentations, live coding, and demos. Short tutorials alternate
with practical exercises.



### Software requirements

You need to install some software *before* CodeRefinery ([why we ask
you to do
this](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/#why-are-we-asking-participants-to-install-software)).
Please do this - *and check it* - in advance, otherwise you'll start off
behind.

Note that, e.g., a working Python executable on your laptop is not sufficient -
a version greater than 3.4 is strongly recommended and a number of extra
packages need to be installed as detailed on the Python installation
page.  **You also need to check your git configuration**
([video: how to configure Git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDTp8NeHBs&list=PLpLblYHCzJACyKCfHnPwRruOxllNoHsEg)).
**If you have an institutional laptop with limited rights, start in advance
and/or ask for help to translate these instructions to work on your system.**

- [Bash](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/bash/)
- [Editor](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/editors/)
- [Git](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/git/), including
  some **configuration**
- [(optional) Visual diff tools](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/difftools/)
- [Python](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/python/)
- [Jupyter and JupyterLab](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/jupyter)
- [Snakemake](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/snakemake)
- [Zoom](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/zoom/)
- University computer specific instructions:
  - [Aalto University](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/news/coderefinery/)

**You should either a) drop by one of our verification sessions in
advance, or b) verify with your team's helper before the workshop.**

### Location

The workshop will be held online, participant links will be sent to
registered participants.  Also streamed at [https://twitch.tv/coderefinery]


### Who the course is for

Are you doing any of these things below:
- You write scripts to process data.
- You change scripts written by your colleagues.
- You write code that is used in research by you or others.

If yes, then this course is for you.  This is not designed for
"professional code developers" or computer scientists.

If you develop research code and you know all the tools
already, join us as a helper! It's fun, and you always learn
something new about a subject by teaching it.


### How to join

We are normally limited by number of helpers, thus:

- Anyone may register as a learner, we will try to take as many as we can.
- Or you can register as a helper.  If you are somewhat comfortable
  with these tools, you can be a helper! (see below)
- Register as a team, one helper and 4-6 learners.
  - We will accept all complete teams.
  - Everyone on the team must register separately.
  - Decide some team name, and when registering, everone enter this
    same name so that we can link you together.
  - During the exercise sessions in breakout rooms, the helper has
    primary responsibility for their group's hands-on exercises.
    Still, instructors drop by to check and help
    as needed, so don't worry if you don't know everything.
  - This is a great opportunity to bring your friends and colleagues
    and prepare for the future together.

If you've been to a CodeRefinery before and have used git some after
that, you are definitely capable of being a helper.  If you routinely
use git and know Python somewhat well, you are also very qualified to
be a helper.


### What we will not teach

This is not a course about a specific programming language or
the Linux/Unix terminal shell.  We assume that you are familiar with the programming
language that you use in your work and research.  We try to keep the course as
language-independent as possible but we will show some basic code examples in
Python.


### Prerequisites

- You should be able to navigate the file tree in a terminal session and edit
  text files in the terminal.
  [This Linux shell crash course](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/shell.html)
  ([video](https://youtu.be/56p6xX0aToI))
  contains the essentials.
- Basics in one or more programming languages.
- You need to install some software. Please follow links at left.
- It is useful if you have a basic idea of how Git works. We will start from
  the basics anyway, but please go through
  [this Git-refresher material](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-refresher/)
  for a basic overview and important configuration steps.
- Make sure that git is configured, and verify the configuration:
  [text instructions](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/git/#configuring-git),
  [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDTp8NeHBs&t=258s).


### Instructors

- TBA


### Helpers

([Tips for
helpers](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/helping-and-teaching/)).
- TBA

### FAQ

- **Why should I come as a team?**  If you will work together later,
  learning the tools at the same time is a great way to do it.

- **Am I good enough to be a helper?**  If you are asking this
  question, probably you are.  You should have some familiarity with
  git, provide some initial advice on obvious error messages, and
  be able to call us for advanced help when it's needed.

- **How does the waitlist work?**  Anyone can register, but you go to
  the waitlist until we can be sure we have enough helpers.  We'll
  continually approve people as we get space.  We know
  this may be more unpredictable for you, but the way to make sure you
  get in is join a team with a helper (or find us more helpers in
  general).
