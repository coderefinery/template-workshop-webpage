## Course goals and format

The workshop will be held online, participant links will be sent to
registered participants. We also typically stream via [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/coderefinery).

In this course, you will become familiar with tools and best practices
for version control in modern research software development. The main
focus is on using Git for efficiently writing and maintaining research
software. We don't teach programming, but we teach the tools you need
to use programming well.

This is an informal and interactive event with type-along lessons, live coding, and demos. 
Short tutorials alternate with practical exercises.
