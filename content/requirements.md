## Prerequisites

- You should be able to navigate the file tree in a terminal session and edit
  text files in the terminal.
  [This Linux shell crash course](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/shell.html)
  ([video](https://youtu.be/56p6xX0aToI))
  contains the essentials.
- Basics in one or more programming languages.
- You need to install some software. See below.
- It is useful if you have a basic idea of how Git works. We will start from
  the basics anyway, but please go through
  [this Git-refresher material](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-refresher/)
  for a basic overview and important configuration steps.
- Make sure that Git is configured, and verify the configuration:

## Software requirements

You need to install some software **before** the workshop
([why we ask you to do this](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/#why-are-we-asking-participants-to-install-software)).
Please do this - and check it - in advance, otherwise you'll start off behind.

Note that, e.g., a working Python executable on your laptop is not sufficient -
a version greater than 3.4 is strongly recommended and a number of extra
packages need to be installed as detailed on the Python installation
page. **You also need to check your git configuration**
([video: how to configure Git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDTp8NeHBs&list=PLpLblYHCzJACyKCfHnPwRruOxllNoHsEg)).

- [Bash](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/bash/)
- [Editor](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/editors/)
- [Git](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/git/), including
  some **configuration**
  - [(optional) git visual diff tools](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/difftools/)
- [Python](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/python/)
- [Jupyter and JupyterLab](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/jupyter)
- [Snakemake](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/snakemake)
- [Zoom](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/zoom/)

**You should either a) drop by one of our verification sessions in
advance, or b) verify with your team's helper before the workshop.**

If you have an institutional laptop with limited rights, start in advance
and/or ask for help to translate these instructions to work on your system.:
