## Prerequisites

- You should be able to navigate the file tree in a terminal session and edit
  text files in the terminal.
  [This Linux shell crash course](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/shell.html)
  ([video](https://youtu.be/56p6xX0aToI))
  contains the essentials.
- Basics in one or more programming languages.
- You need to install some software. See below.
- It is useful if you have a basic idea of how Git works. We will start from
  the basics anyway, but please go through
  [this Git-refresher material](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-refresher/)
  for a basic overview and important configuration steps.
- Make sure that Git is configured, and verify the configuration:

## Software requirements

You need to install some software **before** the workshop
([why we ask you to do this](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/#why-are-we-asking-participants-to-install-software)).
Please do this - and check it - in advance, otherwise you'll start off behind.

Note that, e.g., a working Python executable on your laptop is not sufficient -
a version greater than 3.4 is strongly recommended and a number of extra
packages need to be installed as detailed on the Python installation
page. **You also need to check your git configuration**
([video: how to configure Git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDTp8NeHBs&list=PLpLblYHCzJACyKCfHnPwRruOxllNoHsEg)).

- [Bash](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/bash/)
- [Editor](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/editors/)
- [Git](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/git/), including
  some **configuration**
  - [(optional) git visual diff tools](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/difftools/)
- [Python](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/python/)
- [Jupyter and JupyterLab](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/jupyter)
- [Snakemake](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/snakemake)
- [Zoom](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/zoom/)

**You should either a) drop by one of our verification sessions in
advance, or b) verify with your team's helper before the workshop.**

If you have an institutional laptop with limited rights, start in advance
and/or ask for help to translate these instructions to work on your system.:

## Privacy and tools/ online services

In Coderefinery, we try to teach you tools that we see being used in the
research world and tools we consider important. This sometimes leads to
situations where a tool that is commonly used is not the tool that is most open
or anonymous.

We encourage everyone to install the software we suggest, to be
able to follow the course without additional issues. However, if you do not
want to use the software or services we suggest for any reason (we understand
that there are good reasons for doing so) you should be aware that the hands-on
aspects of the course are unlikely to apply as is.

In any case, we suggest
following the instructors and fellow learners to learn about the suggested
software and its possible differences with your choice of tools. In many cases
there may even be a more open / anonymous tool for the job, we hope you
understand that we can not offer support for every possible tool (everyone has
their preferences). Our decision for using the tools we suggest in this
workshop is based on what we think will be most useful for most of our
learners. Here we try to balance between usefulness and privacy and hope we are
doing a good job. If you are unsure about anything or do not agree with our
choice, feel free to contact us or contribute directly to our lesson material
to make it more inclusive while also being useful for the majority of our
learners.
