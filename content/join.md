### Attend on your own

The promise of the Internet is that we can reach everyone, so why
don't we?  We teach on a Twitch livestream
([twitch.tv/coderefinery](https://twitch.tv/coderefinery)) so that
anyone may attend the workshop.  With livestream attendance, you get:
- Access to all workshop content, text and video
- Lesson recordings released usually on the same day
- A channel for questions (if you register)
- To do exercises yourself, or in a self-organized group

### Attend in a local event

Some of our friends and partners arrange an on-site meetings where they follow the teaching
together and get in-person assistance. Check the main workshop page to find local events near you. 


### Attend with own team

**We recommend that you form your own team and do exercises together in-person
or online.** Especially for week 1. We will support this as much as we can.

You can arrange everything with your friends and colleagues:
- Agree where to meet
- Agree how to follow the workshop
- Maybe have some communications channel for your team
- We send all registered participants information about the workshop
- We don't need to know the details, but let us know if you have a team (for reporting purposes)

These teams can consist of learners only, or they can have one or more people 
who are familiar with the materials taught in our workshop. 
We call them team leaders, please continue reading below.

CodeRefinery's mission is to enable everyone to use the computational
tools they need for their work.  We do this by teaching the most important
software development tools, which are often missed in other coursework.
This is a big task, but together with you, we can do it:

### Volunteer as a Q&A helper

You'd like to help out during the workshop? 
Join us answering questions from the participants in the Q&A document (collaborative notes).

### Be a team leader

If you step up and make yourself available as a **team leader** (for a team with your colleagues or in a local event) at CodeRefinery, and you will:
- Mentor and provide positive encouragement for your team; guide them
  through the workshop.
- Attend our one hour onboarding session (see schedule).
- Have your own team during the course.
- Help keep the team on track.  You are the first line, but you don't
  need to know everything.
- Use the collaborative notes document to ask for support, when needed. 

**Am I good enough to be a team leader?**  If you are asking this
question, probably you are. If you have some familiarity with
Git, you can provide some initial advice on obvious error messages,
but the idea is that you are able to ask for further help when it's needed.

### Arrange your own local event

Do you want to bring the CodeRefinery workshop to your community? 
We are very happy for anyone who wants to organize local public events
 to follow the workshop and provide own on-site support.
If you want to support your local community,
 you can arrange your own local event. This can be on-site or online.
You can choose to arrange your own registration or do the registration via us.  
You and your potential team leaders will get onboarding from us (see schedule).


**You don't have to be located in the Nordics**. We welcome teams and local events from
anyone, also outside the Nordics. These satellite events or local classrooms help
us to reach more people.

### Price and attendance priority policy

The course is free of charge, funded by the [Nordic e-Infrastructure
Collaboration](https://neic.no/).  The livestream can scale up to an arbitrary
number of viewers.  The local partners usually use "first come - first
served"-principle + a waiting list.  Some might also accept only members of
their own organisation. We do not have any influence on this. 
But please know, that you can always follow the workshop on your own.


### Accessibility

We hope that everyone can attend and learn from this workshop, but we
aren't perfect.  Our attempts are mentioned below, if you would like
to help or there is something else we can do, please get in touch.

* Teams provide a community atmosphere
  and private help, even in a big streamed course.
* Local events can provide locally-relevant support, both short and
  long term, without worrying about basic course mechanics.
* Our material is provided in many different formats: writing (lesson
  websites), by presenting, videos/recordings, Q&A, and more.
* We record videos and post the notes so you can review at your own
  pace later on.  Videos completely preserve privacy (don't include
  audience voice or video).
* Raw Twitch videos are available immediately - so you can immediately
  review anything you didn't catch the first time.  This greatly
  reduces pressure from the course.
* We also try to release YouTube videos by the same day, so
  that they are useful for further-refined instant review (even if
  they are not perfect).
* A collaborative document allows everybody to ask questions anonymously and
  asynchronously, without worrying about interrupting others.  (On the
  other hand, there are many questions, so don't let it distract you
  from the main flow).  These notes are published for later review.
* Lesson websites and collaborative document use standard web technologies, so that
  browser accessibility plugins can be used (for example: making the
  font more accessible, check browser extensions).
* Twitch can be live-captioned using the Google Chrome browser.
* You can follow along without providing any personal data
  (without registration to any services, though GitHub registration is
  used for many exercises).
* The course can be attended by an unlimited number of
  people.
* Local sessions with partners and limited global interaction makes
  Code of Conduct monitoring much easier.
* We try to make our written material as accessible as possible, both
  in content and form.  This may not be perfect, but we welcome help
  to make things better.
