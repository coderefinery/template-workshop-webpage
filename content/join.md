## How to join

Anyone may watch the livestream (<https://twitch.tv/coderefinery>), and we
have Zoom for breakout sessions up to our capacity.  Some partners may
even host in-person breakout rooms.  Read more about [how to attend a
livestream
course](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/how-to-attend-stream/).

### Attend via livestream only

The promise of the Internet is that we can reach everyone, so why
don't we?  We teach on a Twitch livestream
([twitch.tv/coderefinery](https://twitch.tv/coderefinery)) so that
anyone may attend the workshop.  With livestream attendance, you get:
- access to all workshop content, text and video.
- lesson recordings released usually on the same day.
- a channel for questions (if you register)
- to do exercises yourself, or in a self-organized group.

Attendees report a great experience with these livestream courses!
You *will* be able to ask us questions if you register.

**Please register anyway so that you can get emails and we can better
report our impact.**


### Attend via livestream + CodeRefinery Zoom

To provide interactive support, we also host also a Zoom session.
Learners watch the livestream during teaching, and discuss in Zoom during
exercises.

In Zoom, we group attendees into teams with an exercise leaders and
help from our staff. This makes a very interactive workshop, but
unfortunately we have limited resources to accept these
registrations.

With Zoom attendance, you get:
- everything the livestream does
- discussion in teams and a bit more help


### Attend with an own team

**We recommend that you form your own team and do exercises together in-person or online.**

We will support this as much as we can!
Everyone in team register by themselves.

You can arrange everything with your friends and colleagues:
- agree where to meet
- agree how to follow the workshop
- maybe have some communications channel for your team
- we send all registrants all information about the workshop
- we don't need to know the details, but let us know if you have a team (for reporting purposes)


Team Exercise Lead(s) should mark their interest in being an EL when registering so that they get the additional information about Onboarding for exercise leads, instructors, organizers, observers and a calendar invitation with connection information.


### Attend in a local partner's event

Some of our partners arrange an onsite meetings where they follow
the teaching together and get in-person assistance.
Check if one of
[our partners](https://coderefinery.github.io/2022-09-20-workshop/#partners)
is organising such an event, or if your educational institute has
an event of their own. Feel free to suggest your educational institute to
[become a partner](https://coderefinery.org/organization/partners/#joining-as-a-partner)
and/or arrange a local breakout room.


### FAQ: how should I register?

- **I am registering alone (not as part of a team) and want to work with others face-to-face, how should I register?**
  - The registration form has an option: "I might be interested in following in-person". Use that to get more information about local events that we a aware of. If there's no local event in your area you get our exercise Zoom link. (In an unlikely event where even the Zoom is full then you get the livestream anyway.)
- **I am making my own team, how should I register?**
  - The registration form has an option: "I might form a team with my colleagues". Make sure you team has at least one exercise lead and that they have announced that while registering so they get the additional information about Onboarding for exercise leads, instructors, organizers, observers and a calendar invitation with connection information.
- **Our team will work together in a physical room, is there any point to joining the CodeRefinery Zoom?**
  - No need. If you all get stuck in the exercises you can ask questions via the Q&A channel.
    (Note that Zoom etc. can still be useful in the physical room for screensharing with each other).
- **Does everyone on the team need to register?**
  - Yes please. Then everyone gets emails and the connection details directly from us.
    Your exercise lead(s) should also mark their interest of being an Exercise leader at the registration register at "Onboarding
    registration for exercise leads, instructors, organizers, observers" so
    that they get the additional information about Onboarding for exercise leads, instructors, organizers, observers and a calendar invitation with connection information.
- **I want to be an exercise lead or an observer. How do I register?**
  - The registration form has an option: "I might be interested in being a general helper, co-instructor or observer". We will then send you more information and the additional information about Onboarding for exercise leads, instructors, organizers, observers and a calendar invitation with connection information.
- **I'm an organization or group, I want to sponsor my community's teams!**
  - Great! In general what you can do is to gather people together to follow the workshop.
    [Read more about local breakout rooms](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/local-breakout-rooms/)
    and [contact us](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/chat/).
  - If you arrange a local event, advertise it and let us know so we can also advertise it to the registrants!
  - Please guide everyone to register in our registration form.
    - You get email from us with the contact details of interested participants in your area
- **I registered and changed my mind about a team. What do I do?**
  - Please let us know in [support@coderefinery.org](mailto:support@coderefinery.org)


### Price and attendance priority policy

The course is free of charge, funded by the [Nordic e-Infrastructure
Collaboration](https://neic.no/).

The livestream can scale up to an arbitrary number of viewers, but in the exercise Zoom we are limited by number of helpers and exercise leaders.
When we have more sign-ups as **individual learners** for exercise groups than
our capacity allows, the following priority criteria apply:

1. Partner communities
2. National universities or research institutes in Nordic countries and Estonia
3. Private companies and government agencies in Nordic countries or Estonia
4. European national universities or research institutes from outside the Nordics.
5. Others

*Therefore it is very important that you use an email address
corresponding to your affiliation.*

If you aren't accepted to the Zoom session, you can always attend the stream part.

More Exercise leads and general helpers allow more capacity: if you come as a **complete team** (i.e. including at least one exercise leader for each day) or **Exercise lead** with some friends, we will accept you up to the technical capacity of our meeting.


### Accessibility

We hope that everyone can attend and learn from this workshop, but we
aren't perfect.  Our attempts are mentioned below, if you would like
to help or there is something else we can do, please get in touch.

* Breakout rooms with exercise leaders gives a community atmosphere
  and private help.
* Our material is provided in writing (lesson websites), by voice, and
  by demo.
* We record videos and post the notes so you can review at your own
  pace later on.  Videos don't include audience voice or video.
* HackMD allows anyone to ask questions anonymously and
  asynchronously, without interrupting others.  On the other hand,
  there are a *lot* of questions, so don't let it distract you from
  the main lecture.
* Lesson websites/HackMD use standard web technologies, so that
  browser accessibility plugins can be used (for example making the
  font more accessible, check browser extensions).
* Twitch can be live-captioned using the Google Chrome browser.
* You can follow along without providing any personal data
  (registration, Twitch works with cookies blocked).
* We have figures in some lessons which are somewhat important,
  without good alt text.  We are working on this, contributions
  welcome.
