## How to join

We are normally limited by number of helpers, thus:

- Anyone may register as a learner, we will try to take as many as we can.
- Complete teams are preferred: one helper and 4-6 learners:
  - Everyone on the team must register separately.
  - Decide on a team name, and when registering,
    so that we can link teammates together.
  - During the exercise sessions in breakout rooms, the helper has
    primary responsibility for their group's hands-on exercises.
    Still, instructors drop by to check and help
    as needed, so don't worry if as a helper you don't know everything.
  - This is a great opportunity to bring your friends and colleagues
    and prepare for the future together.
- If you routinely use Git and know Python somewhat well or you've been to
  a CodeRefinery before, you are definitely capable of being a helper and register as one!

**Why should I come as a team?**  If you will work together later,
  learning the tools at the same time is a great way to do it.

**Am I good enough to be a helper?**  If you are asking this
  question, probably you are.  You should have some familiarity with
  git, provide some initial advice on obvious error messages, and
  be able to call us for advanced help when it's needed.

**How does the waiting list work?**  Anyone can register, but you go to
  the waiting list until we can be sure we have enough helpers.  We'll
  continually approve people as we get space.  We know
  this may be more unpredictable for you, but the way to make sure you
  get in is join a team with a helper (or find us more helpers in
  general).


### Price and priority policy

The course is free of charge, we are funded by the [Nordic e-Infrastructure
Collaboration](https://neic.no/).

When we have more sign-ups than our capacity allows, the following priority criteria apply:

1. National universities or research institutes in Nordic countries and Estonia
2. Private companies and government agencies in Nordic countries or Estonia
3. European national universities or research institutes from outside the Nordics.
4. Others

Therefore it is very important that you use an email address corresponding to your affiliation.
