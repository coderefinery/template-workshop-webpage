### Week 2

In week 2, the instructors will go through exercises on stream and invite
learners to participate with questions using the collaborative document.

We will not switch between lectures and group exercise sessions in week 2.  For
groups that wish to go through exercises on their own, we recommend to schedule
separate sessions for this.
