## List of exercises

We provide this list to make it easier for team leads to prepare and navigate
lesson material.  We often change the material before each workshop and in this
page we list also any ongoing or planned changes to avoid surprises.


### Day 1 (Git intro)

- [Recording changes](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/basics/#exercise-record-changes) (20 min). There are also optional exercises.
- [Branching and merging](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/branches/#exercise-create-and-commit-to-branches) (20 min). There are also optional exercises.
- [Conflict resolution](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/conflicts/#exercise-create-and-resolve-a-conflict) (20 min).


### Day 2 (Git intro)

- [Pushing to GitHub](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/remotes/#pushing-our-guacamole-recipe-repository-to-github) (20 min). We push the recipe from day 1 to GitHub.
- [Inspecting history](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/archaeology/#exercise-basic-archaeology-commands) (30 min). The part with `git bisect` is optional.
- [Undoing and recovering](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/recovering/) (20 min). We let participants/groups choose among:
  - Revert a commit
  - Modify a previous commit
  - Git reset


### Day 3 (collaborative Git)

We will keep these exercises but **will change the description** so that there is less to read when participating in an exercise:
- [Create a pull request](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/centralized/#exercise-preparation) (30 min):
  Creating a branch and commit, pushing the branch, creating a pull request, and reviewing pull requests.
- [Working with forks](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/distributed/#exercise-preparation) (30 min).


### Day 4 (reproducible research and social coding)

- [Dependencies-1 and Dependencies-2](https://coderefinery.github.io/reproducible-research/dependencies/#exercises) (20 min)
- [Workflow-1 and Workflow-2](https://coderefinery.github.io/reproducible-research/workflow-management/#exercise) (20 min)
- Rest is collaborative "discussion" in collaborative document and demo
- No individual/group exercise in the social coding part. We will all participate via collaborative document.
  In other words nothing to prepare for team leads.


### Day 5 (Jupyter and documentation)

- [First computational notebook](https://coderefinery.github.io/jupyter/first-notebook/#an-example-computational-notebook) (20 min).
- [Sharing a notebook using Binder](https://coderefinery.github.io/jupyter/sharing/) (20 min).
- [Writing good README files](https://coderefinery.github.io/documentation/writing-readme-files/) (15 min). Learners/groups can choose 1 of the 3 exercises there.
- [Sphinx and Markdown](https://coderefinery.github.io/documentation/sphinx/#exercise-sphinx-content) (20 min). There are optional exercises.


### Day 6 (testing and modular code development)

- **Instead of practicing testing locally** the first exercise will be about
  setting up [automated testing](https://coderefinery.github.io/testing/continuous-integration/) (20 min).
  We also plan to offer an R exercise for those who prefer R over Python.
- [Test design](https://coderefinery.github.io/testing/test-design/) (20 min). No significant changes planned.
- No individual/group exercise in modular code development. Learners will
  participate all via collaborative document and ask and advice instructors.
